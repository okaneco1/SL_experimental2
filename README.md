# Sea Lamprey Experiment 2

### Project Setup
Sea lamprey were allowed to feed on two consecutive hosts (either lake trout or white sucker) in a controlled setting. After 7 days of feeding on both, sea lamprey were euthanized and stomach contents were removed for DNA extraction. DNA metabarcoding was carried out on each of the samples, to determine whether the presence of both hosts (i.e. a feeding history) could be determined via these methods. 

### Data Analysis
Bioinformatic processing of sequence data was performed in on the MSU HPCC via mothur (same run as SL_experimental1). Downstream data analysis was performed in R, including data organization, statistical analyses, and visualizations
