## Host Switching Data Analysis
This analysis investigates the retention of host fish DNA in sea lamprey following consecutive feedings on two host species: lake trout and white sucker. The analysis examines the impact of fasting periods, weight gain, adn days attached on host DNA detection.

*Sequence Read Count Calculation:* Host fish DNA read counts are summed and visualized to compare lake trout and white sucker sequence proportions across samples.
*Host Detection:* Detections are based on a read count threshold and relative abundance. Detection columns for both replicates are included.
*Descriptive Statistics:* Detection proportions across fasting days are calculated and visualized with bar charts.
*Statistical Modeling:* Logistic regression models explore the relationship between host detections and variables such as fasting days and weight gain. Negative binomial regression is selected based on AIC comparison.
*Data Visualization:* Various plots visualize the effect of fasting days and weight gain on host DNA detection, with model results providing insights into DNA detectability.
